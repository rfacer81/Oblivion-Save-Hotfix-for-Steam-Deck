Simply run this file as an administrator from your Windows PC. Any game files saved in the local "%USER%\Documents\My Games\Oblivion Remastered\Saved\SaveGames" directory will be copied to the "%USER\OneDrive\Documents\My Games\Oblivion Remastered\Saved\SaveGames" directory, and visa versa. 

No game saves are deleted in this process.
